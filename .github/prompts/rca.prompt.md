# Root Cause Analysis Documentation

Use this prompt when documenting root cause analysis for production incidents.

## RCA Documentation Requirements

REQUIRE GitHub Issue for every production incident requiring RCA.

### Issue Template Fields

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the incident
2. **Impact**: Users affected, duration, severity
3. **Timeline**: When detected, when resolved, key events
4. **Framework(s) Used**: OODA, FTA, 5 Whys, Fishbone, etc.
5. **Analysis**: FTA diagram, 5 Whys chains, or OODA timeline
6. **Root Cause**: The underlying cause identified
7. **Contributing Factors**: Secondary causes
8. **Preventive Measures**: Actions to prevent recurrence
9. **Verification**: How preventive measures were validated

### Required Labels

- `incident`
- `rca`
- `severity-critical` | `severity-high` | `severity-medium` | `severity-low`

### Linking Requirements

REQUIRE:

- Incident -> RCA issue link
- RCA issue -> Preventive commits link
- Preventive commits -> RCA issue reference
- Close issue only after preventive measures implemented and verified

### Documentation Principles

ENFORCE DRY:

- RCA content lives in GitHub Issue
- Reference from commits/PRs, do not duplicate
- Operational incidents tracked in Issues, not repository docs

ENFORCE SSOT:

- GitHub Issues are the single source of truth for incident tracking
- Runbook updates reference the originating issue
- Post-incident reviews link to the RCA issue
